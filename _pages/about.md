Hello! This is Donghyeon Shin's website. Here, you will be able to review a brief portfolio and CV about me.

I am a master student in AI Graduate School at GIST AI Data Science lab with [Prof. Sundong](https://sundong.kim/).


My primary research interests lie in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and exploring reinforcement learning (RL). Currently, I am particularly focused on developing AI models aligned with human values. To achieve this, I am investigating methods to construct knowledge graphs from natural language and applying skill-based reinforcement learning approaches grounded in these graphs.

Below, I introduce the projects I worked on during my masterâ€™s program.
