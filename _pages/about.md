I am a senior student in Electronic Engineering & Computer Science at [Gwangju Istitute of Science and Technology](https://www.gist.ac.kr/kr/main.html). And I am an undergraduate intern at GIST AI Data Science lab.

I am interested in deep learning, how to apply human reasoning and abstraction to AI. Before I participated in GIST AI Data Science lab, I was an intern at the Scientific Computing lab, advised by Prof. [Chi-Ok Hwang](https://clabs.gist.ac.kr/~chwang/). Now, I am researching on [Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge).
